<h1>About:</h1>
<p>This program is used to solve system of linear equation in any number of variable. If an equation has infinte number of solution, it gives any one solution it finds. Otherwise, if exact solution then you will get that. In case of over-determined or no solution, it will tell that no solution found. If any failure case found, please inform failed equation in issues.</p>
<h1>How to build:</h1>
<p>Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2022, and compile it there. Make sure if you have installed required templates in Visual Studio 2022 for it.</p>
